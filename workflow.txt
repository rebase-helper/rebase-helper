Prerequisite is to copy a new upstream release to a GIT repository of relevant package.

How Rebase-Helper should work.
- Each action should be logged and visible by user.
- extract tarball with the existing sources to directory <package_name>
- extract tarball with the new sources to directory <package_name>-rebasehelper
- Provide a list of patches mentioned in SPEC file
- apply first patch to existing directory <package_name>
- Try to apply the first patch to <package_name>-rebasehelper
- If the patch passed go to another if not try to apply them via fuzz
- If the patch failed run a DiffHelper to correct a patch.
- Save the corrected patch to <org_name>-rebase.patch
- Go through all patche
- Run rpmdiff tool for finding libraries and header changes.
- Inform user what libraries and header files were changed.

What is currently missing:
- PatchHelper class - abstract class with at least one Patch Helper (mostly patch command)
- DiffHelper class - abstract class with at least one Diff Helper (like vimdiff, Meld)
    - Each DiffHelper class can have different syntax
- RPMDiff class - use the class for getting information what was changed against previous version
- Report class - it can be used for reporting things discovered during rebasing.
    - like what patches were changed.
    - what headers and libraries were changed.

Nice to have:
- If library was change (like soname bump) try to execute repoquery to find out what packages needs the library.

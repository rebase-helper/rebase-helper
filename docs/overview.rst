Introduction
============

Let's summarize what is included by default and some future aims for the `libdoug`:

* Hub/Registry

  - Get API `token` from Hub upon authenticating
  - `Token` cached for 2 hours
  - Also gives `ro` access for public registries
  - Public registries are hidden behind special user `stackbrew`
  - Fetch all tags in a repository

* Updates

  - Handle local/remote updates to a repository
  - Repo diffs, Image trees, Conflict solvers ...

    + Version-Release conflict solver
    + Works kinda like RPMs
    + Push/Pull the highest version, remove the rest

* Docker API and diagnostics tools

  - Got a 4 line long docker command trying to figure out what it does?

    + or need a sensible format for logging? See the example of `docker-cli` sub-command above
  - Programmatic definitions of the following Docker APIs: CLI, Docker socket v.1.16, Registry, Hub

    + Autogenerated with (and manually fine-tuned): https://github.com/shaded-enmity/docker-devour
  - The `dependencies` sub-command can be used for visualizing deeply nested hierarchies of images

* What's in the works

  - Toolchain for propagation of information about updates in the infrastructure

    + When a new `Version-Release` tag appers in the remote, we should rebase all local children on top of the new one
    + That means editing `Dockerfile`'s and issuing `build` requests
    + Or editing of `k8s` pod `YAML` s
